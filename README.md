# ELEC390project
The goal of the project is to build a desktop app that can distinguish between ‘walking’ and ‘jumping’ with a reasonable accuracy, using the data collected from the accelerometers of a smartphone.

Description:
The project involves building a small and simple desktop application that accepts accelerometer
data (x, y, and z axes) in CSV format, and writes the outputs into a separate CSV file. The output
CSV file contains the labels (‘walking’ or ‘jumping’) for the corresponding input data. For
classification purposes, the system will use a simple classifier, i.e., logistic regression.
